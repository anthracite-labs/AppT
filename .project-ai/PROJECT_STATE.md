# Project State

This file is a bounded snapshot of accepted, durable project reality.

Record only the current project position. Do not use it as a diary, backlog, CI log, architecture document, changelog, project profile, or chat history.

Update it only when accepted reality materially changes. Activity alone is not state. A pull request opening, a test failing, Arena starting work, a workflow running, or an implementation commit does not by itself justify an update.

Reconcile this file after accepted work has landed on `main`. It describes accepted reality, never anticipated reality.

## Phase

Implementation.

## Current Objective

Compile and dispatch S04 — Saved pairing, fail-closed identity, and the safe forget primitive — as the next authorized implementation slice.

Success means S04 is implemented and accepted against the existing architecture and slice contract while preserving S03's first-control/session boundaries and the accepted security, privacy, supply-chain, and verification floor.

## Accepted Decisions

- `docs/PRODUCT.md` owns approved product intent; product discovery is complete.
- `CONTEXT.md` owns canonical AppT domain language.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/architecture/` own accepted technical direction and detailed architecture.
- The accepted implementation route is S01–S17 in `docs/architecture/slices.md`, executed one authorized slice at a time.
- S01 is accepted through PR #30.
- The pre-S02 security baseline is accepted through PR #38.
- Verification and independent AI-code assurance are accepted through PR #60.
- S02 is accepted through implementation PR #75 and corrective closeout PR #77.
- S03 is accepted through implementation PR #80.
- Repository CI/agent-control and verification hardening are accepted through PR #89.
- Mandatory lifecycle skill routing and diagnose-before-fix gates are accepted through PR #84.
- S04 is the next authorized implementation slice.
- S07 may be dependency-ready but is not active or authorized.
- Provider facts marked `needs validation` must be confirmed when they first become implementation-relevant.
- Final AppT source-license selection and focused Samsung vendor-terms/legal review remain pre-public-release gates.
- Project commands and execution-environment facts are owned by `docs/BUILD.md`, project configuration, and `.github/workflows/verify.yml`.

## Durable Blockers

None for S04 dispatch.

## Latest Accepted Milestone

S03 — Pair on the television and the first command — accepted through PR #80.

## Next Authorized Action

Use `.project-ai/skills/implementation-planning/SKILL.md` and `.project-ai/execution/arena-dispatch.md` to compile and dispatch S04.
